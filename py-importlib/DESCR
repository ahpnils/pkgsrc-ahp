This package contains the code from importlib as found in Python 2.7.
It is provided so that people who wish to use importlib.import_module()
with a version of Python prior to 2.7 or in 3.0 have the function
readily available.
The code in no way deviates from what can be found
in the Python 2.7 standard library.
